                    Observations such as the CMB, strong gravitational lensing and rotation curves have confirmed the existence of dark matter, but its nature is still unknown. Different models propose that the properties of dark matter affect how it interacts with matter and is distributed, which allows us to explore or constrain the fundamental properties of dark matter through specific methods.

                    At present, we do not know whether dark energy is a field or where it originates, so we need to consider whether it might be produced by some astrophysical process or whether it could be related to interactions within the standard particle physics model. There are various models of dark energy, some of which are closely related to research on dark matter, cosmic inflation, and particle physics. Based on these candidate models, we can identify or constrain the nature of dark energy by observing specific signals.

                    Cosmology is a rapidly advancing discipline. As suggested, we should have already entered the era of 'Cosmonoy.' Precise overall observations of the universe require the development of various new methods to obtain cosmology-independent measurements, thereby constraining cosmological models. In addition, acquiring new high-quality data is also an essential part of precision cosmology. a. Utilizing data from high redshift observations (e.g., JWST/SKA) to measure cosmological parameters.
                    b. Developing new method for cosmological model analysis.
