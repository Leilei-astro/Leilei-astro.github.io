I am currently a PhD candidate in Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) and University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). \

I was born and raised in two villages in Gansu (陇) Province in western China, called CiWa (茨屲) Village and Budong (堡东) Village, where there are brilliant starry skies, rolling mountains, shallow dams, and slender rivers.
